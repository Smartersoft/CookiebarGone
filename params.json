This plugin automatically accepts all those popups/cookiebars.\r\n\r\nWe need a plugin for this because everyone accepts all those cookies anyway. And we cannot choose to not accept the cookies and still see the website. A good solution is to clear your cookies on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n[Install the Safari plugin](CookiebarGone.safariextz)\r\n\r\n## Found a site we don't support?\r\nPlease create an [issue](https://github.com/Smartersoft/CookiebarGone/issues/new) with the url. And if it you know how to find the ```id/class/query```, please add those as well.\r\n\r\n## Only Safari?\r\nAt the moment we only support safari, but we are working on the Chrome version as we speak.\r\n\r\n# Developers\r\nCheck our [repository](https://github.com/Smartersoft/CookiebarGone) to check to code, or help us building this plugin.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
